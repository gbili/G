G_Db_Req

The G_Molecule_Savable class, uses the G_Db_Req to save
the instances extending it.
The G_Molecule_Savable class should be extended, by those objects
that represent an element with an id in the database.
For those classes, the G_Molecule_Savable makes sure every attribute
in the extending class gets saved to the databse.
When G_Molecule_Savable::save() is called, all the attributes that
are an instance of G_Molecule_Savable get saved too, making their ids
available to the first class that called G_Molecule_Savable::save().
This results in a chained call to save().

The class in charge of saving the G_Molecule_Savable's content to the
Db is G_Db_Req.
Every class extending the G_Molecule_Savable class should tell it's
parent which requestor to use when save() is called.
This can be done explicitely by calling the G_Molecule_Savable::setRequestorClassName($name)
or it will be guessed implicitely from within the G_Molecule_Savable::save()
method that calls G_Db_Registry::getInstance($callerClassName) mathod.
The latter will search inside the registry to see if there is an instance
of the requestor specified by $callerClassName . <classNameEndPart>.
So if your class is MyName_John the requestor that the registry will
try to get or automatically instantiate is MyName_John_<classNameEndPart>.
<classNameEndPart> by default is '_Db_Requestor'.
If you use the Zend_Autoloader class naming convention this will 
try to load the class "MyName_John_Db_Requestor" with the path:
"./MyName/John/Db/Requestor.php".
This type of requestor loading convention, allows to give up a lot
of unnecesary requestor instantiation within the G_Molecule_Savable
subclass. On the other hand it forces you to have a G_Db_Req
subclass for every G_Molecule_Savable subclass, or to specify the name
of the G_Sotrage_Requestor subclass to use for every G_Molecule_Subclass.

There are times when you will not want to use the G_Molecule_Savable
class, but only a simple G_Db_Req instance because it suits
your needs. When this case arises, you probably won't want to have twenty
instances of the G_Db_Req class. 
To allow you avoid that the G_Db_Req class has a registry that
can store one instance of itself at a time. This is sort of a lousy singleton
registry implementation; you cannot specify a key and store an instance 
per key. But it is also lighter. And fits to most applications.
There are many times where you don't need to create different requestor
instances because you don't use more than one database. In that situation
you can call G_Db_Req::register() method and then retrieve it
later in the script by calling G_Db_Req::getRegisteredInstance()
static method.
The register() method is not static so you must create an instance
to register it. If you pass no parameter to the constructor, you will
get the fallbackPrefix'ed adater. That's the type of instance that you
get when you call getRegisteredInstance() and there is no instance
in the registry. Otherwise if you need to instantiate a requestor with
a different adapter, you will need to first set the prefixed adapter
from the G_Db_Req_Abstract::setPrefixedAdapter($prefix, $adapter)
static method, and then pass that $prefix to the G_Db_Req::__construct($prefix)
it will automatically instantiate the requestor with the right
adapter.
Don't use the G_Db_Req registry capabilities if some
adapters cannot be shared, it will cause security issues.
