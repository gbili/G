/**
 * The routeStartup method in a controller plugin is called before the 
 * routing process is started. This lets us hook in before the router 
 * and change the request URL to something it will understand.
 * 
 * As you can see, the code is mostly the same as the code in the __call 
 * method. The main difference is in the few last lines, which replace 
 * the old request URL with a one we craft in the plugin. 
 * 
 * This method is somewhat better than using __call, as itï¿½s much easier 
 * to plug in a project or remove, as you can just use registerPlugin() 
 * in the front controller. 
 * 
 * This one does have one outstanding fault in the way it is right now, 
 * though: If you use any other kinds of URLs than the product-number-category.html 
 * kind, this one will get seriously messed up. You will need to add some additional 
 * checking to make sure that the URL is indeed the kind we would want 
 * to process using the plugin.
